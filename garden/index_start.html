<h2 align="center">Why Native Plants?</h2>
<p>
  Invasive species are plants and animals that are transported to a new
  environment from a different region, over-running and destroying the growth of
  plants in their natural home. This changes habitats for the worse and often
  causes the extinction of our own native plants. Native plants are what keep
  our environment thriving, unaffected, and ideal. These plants collect the
  water run-off from their area, preventing floods, and improving the air
  quality. With them, a happy, safe ecosystem is guaranteed not only for the
  animals that live within it, but also you.
</p>
<p>A few benefits include:</p>
<p>
  Healthier and Stronger Plants - Native plants are meant to grow where they
  are. They are much better suited to the soil and climate and will thrive.
</p>
<p>
  Water Waste Decrease - This is their home, meaning extra water and fertilizer
  are not necessary.
</p>
<p>
  Preserves Biodiversity - Biodiversity is the connection between everything in
  its natural environment. Our native plants play an important role in providing
  shelter and food for native insects and wildlife.
</p>
<h2 align="center">Why Help Pollinators?</h2>
<p>
  Pollination is a vital part of plant reproduction for 75 % of the world’s
  flowering plants and 35% of food crops. Pollinator plants attract various
  animal species, providing them with necessary nectar and pollen used as food.
  In turn, the animals spread pollen grains from plant to plant which produces
  the seeds needed for new plant growth. Those new plants support other animals
  including humans, both directly and indirectly. Pollinators include bats,
  butterflies, some birds, moths, beetles, and most importantly bees. Without
  them, about half of the fruits and vegetables we eat would not be able to
  grow. However, pollinators are under a serious threat. Many bee species are on
  a decline, and bats appear to be disappearing. Simply, there aren’t enough
  pollinator plants to support their populations. You can help by planting
  native pollinator plants in your own garden.
</p>
<h2 align="center">What is a puddler and why is it important?</h2>
<p>
  If you are facing the sign, the puddler is located in the top left corner of
  the garden. A butterfly puddler is a beneficial addition to a pollinator
  garden. In a dish filled with wet sand, small pebbles, and larger rocks,
  butterflies can congregate and extract much-needed nutrients, including water,
  dissolved salts and minerals. A puddler is relatively DIY with accessible
  resources you can find around the house. To make one, you need a planter drip
  tray., sand, small pebbles, and rocks. The rocks for our puddler were
  excavated during sod removal for the garden. It is vital to keep it damp for
  the butterflies but avoid standing water. You can sprinkle salt on the sand
  occasionally. Adding cut-up pieces of over-ripe fruit like bananas and oranges
  will help attract even more butterflies.

  Also, be certain to look at the projects of my fellow Girl Scouts. We all
  contributed to ensuring our pollinators have the resources they need. One
  garden, the shade garden, can be viewed from the nature center windows
  overlooking the pond. Near the nature center, look for posts with bat houses
  on them.

  Girl Scout Troop 420 would like to thank the staff at Mambourg Park and
  Fairfield County Parks for their invaluable assistance in completing our
  pollinator project.
