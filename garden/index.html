          <h1>Why Native Plants?</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8">
          <p>
            Invasive species are plants and animals that are transported to a
            new environment from a different region, over-running and destroying
            the growth of plants in their natural home. This changes habitats
            for the worse and often causes the extinction of our own native
            plants. Native plants are what keep our environment thriving,
            unaffected, and ideal. These plants collect the water run-off from
            their area, preventing floods, and improving the air quality. With
            them, a happy, safe ecosystem is guaranteed not only for the animals
            that live within it, but also you.
          </p>
          <p>A few benefits include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="bg-info">Healthier and Stronger Plants</span> -
              Native plants are meant to grow where they are. They are much
              better suited to the soil and climate and will thrive.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bg-info">Water Waste Decrease</span> - This is their
              home, meaning extra water and fertilizer are not necessary.

            <li>
              <span class="bg-info">Preserves Biodiversity</span> - Biodiversity
              is the connection between everything in its natural environment.
              Our native plants play an important role in providing shelter and

          <h1>Why Help Pollinators?</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-2"></div>
        <div class="col-md-8">
          <p>
            Pollination is a vital part of plant reproduction for 75 % of the
            world's flowering plants and 35% of food crops. Pollinator plants
            attract various animal species, providing them with necessary nectar
            and pollen used as food. In turn, the animals spread pollen grains
            from plant to plant which produces the seeds needed for new plant
            growth. Those new plants support other animals including humans,
            both directly and indirectly. Pollinators include bats, butterflies,
            some birds, moths, beetles, and most importantly bees. Without them,
            about half of the fruits and vegetables we eat would not be able to
            grow. However, pollinators are under a serious threat. Many bee
            species are on a decline, and bats appear to be disappearing.
            Simply, there aren't enough pollinator plants to support their
            populations. You can help by planting native pollinator plants in
            your own garden.

          <h1>What is a puddler and why is it important?</h1>

        <div class="col-md-4 portfolio-item">
          <img class="img-responsive" src="img/image029.jpg" alt="puddler" />

        <div class="col-md-8">
          <p>
            If you are facing the sign, the puddler is located in the top left
            corner of the garden. A butterfly puddler is a beneficial addition
            to a pollinator garden. In a dish filled with wet sand, small
            pebbles, and larger rocks, butterflies can congregate and extract
            much-needed nutrients, including water, dissolved salts and
            minerals. A puddler is relatively DIY with accessible resources you
            can find around the house. To make one, you need a planter drip
            tray, sand, small pebbles, and rocks. The rocks for our puddler were
            excavated during sod removal for the garden. It is vital to keep it
            damp for the butterflies but avoid standing water. You can sprinkle
            salt on the sand occasionally. Adding cut-up pieces of over-ripe
            fruit like bananas and oranges will help attract even more
            butterflies.
